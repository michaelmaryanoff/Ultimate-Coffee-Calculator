# Simple Coffee Calculator

Every morning while brewing my coffee, I would yell at my personal digital assistant (let's call her "Alexandra" for copyright purposes) to calculate the proper coffee to water ratio. I felt bad for my wife and I think it was scaring my dog, so I created this simple coffee calculator so I wouldn't have to do that anymore! And now you can use it too!

It utilizes a simple, easy to use interface that you will be able to read even before you've had your morning coffee.

To input the amount of coffee you will be using, just tap on the coffee text field and input the number of grams of coffee you will be brewing.

You can then adjust the ratio by tapping on the number to the right of the colon under the word "ratio". The water field will update automatically with the amount of water to use (in grams).

You can also input the amount of water you will be using and the app will automatically divide by the ratio provided.

This app utilizes no external libraries, so installing is as simple as downloading the binary file and running.
